I wrote an _extremely detailed_ post on the [various ways to define Gaussian processes](https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-03-yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness/yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness.html). And I did not do that because I just love inflicting Hilbert spaces on people. In fact, the only reason that I ever went beyond the standard operational definition of GPs that most people live their whole lives using is that I needed to. \n\nTwice. \n\nThe first time was when I needed to understand approximation properties of a certain class of GPs. [I wrote a post about it](https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-24-getting-into-the-subspace/getting-into-the-subspace.html). It's intense^[The most common feedback was \"I hung in for as long as I could\".].\n\nThe second time that I really needed to dive into their arcana and apocrypha^[If you don't think we're gonna get our Maccabees on you're dreamin'. Hell, I might have to post Enoch-ussy on main.] was when I foolishly asked the question _can we compute PC priors for Gaussian processes?_.\n\nThe answer was yes. But it's a bit tricky.\n\nSo today I'm going to walk you through the ideas. There's no real need to read the GP post before this one^[you might just need to trust me at some points], but it would be immensely useful to have at least glanced at the [post on PC priors](https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-08-29-priors4/priors4.html).\n\n## How do you put a prior on parameters of a Gaussian process?\n\nWe are in the situation where we have a model that looks something like this^[It could be easily more complex with multilevel component, multiple GPs, time series components etc etc. But the simplest example is a GP regression.] ^[The GP has mean zero for the same reason we usually centre our covariates: it lets the intercept model the overall mean.]\n\\begin{align*}\ny_i \\mid \\beta, u, \\theta &\\sim p(y_i \\sim \\beta, u, \\phi) \\\\\nu(\\cdot) \\mid \\theta &\\sim GP(0, c_\\theta) \\\\\n\\beta, \\phi &\\sim p(\\beta,\\phi),\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $c_\\theta(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is a covariance function with parameters $\\theta$ and we need to specify a joint prior on the GP parameters $\\theta$.\n\nThe simplest case of this would be GP regression, but a key thing here is that, in general, the structure (or functional form) of the priors on $\\theta$ probably shouldn't be too tightly tied to the tied to the specific likelihood. Why do I say that? Well the _scaling_ of a GP should depend on information about the likelihood, but it's hard to make a compelling case for the other type of information conveyed by a prior to depend on it.\n\nNow this view is predicated on us wanting to make an informative prior. In some very special cases, people with too much time on their hands have derived reference priors for specific models involving GPs.  These priors care _deeply_ about which likelihood you use. In fact, if you use them with a different model^[Not just the likelihood but also everything else in the model], you may not end up with a proper^[A challenge with reference priors is that they are often improper (aka they don't integrate to 1). This causes some conceptual difficulties, but there is a whole theory of Bayes that's mostly fine with this as long as the resulting posterior integrates to one. But this is by no means guaranteed and is typically only checked in very specific cases.  Jim Berger, one of the bigger proponents of reference prior, used to bring his wife to conference poster sessions. When she got bored, she would simply find a grad student and ask them if they'd checked if the posterior was proper. Sometimes you need to make your own fun.] posterior.We will talk about those later.\n\nTo start, let's look at the simplest way to build a PC prior. We will then talk about why this is not a good idea.\n\n### A first crack at a PC prior\n\nAs always, the best place to start is the simplest possible option. There's always a hope^[Hope has no place in statistics.] that we won't need to pull out the big guns. \n\nSo what is the simplest solution? Well it's to treat a GP as just a specific multivariate Gaussian distribution \n$$\nu \\sim GP(0, \\sigma^2R(\\theta)),\n$$\nwhere $R(\\theta)$ is a correlation matrix.\n\nThe nice thing about a multivariate Gaussian is that we have a clean expression for its Kullback-Leibler divergence. Wikipedia tells us that for an $n$-dimensional multivariate Gaussian\n$$\n2\\operatorname{KL}(N(0, \\Sigma) || N(0, \\Sigma_0)) = \\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\Sigma_0^{-1}\\Sigma\\right) + \\log \\det \\Sigma_0 - \\log \\det \\Sigma- n.\n$$\nTo build a PC prior we need to consider a base model. That's tricky in generality, but as we've assumed that the covariance matrix can be decomposed into the variance $\\sigma^2$ and a correlation matrix $R(\\theta)$, we can at least specify an easy base model for $\\sigma$. As always, the simplest model is one with no GP in it, which corresponds to $\\sigma_\\text{base} = 0$. From here, we can follow the usual steps to specify the PC prior \n$$\np(\\sigma) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda \\sigma},\n$$\nwhere we choose $\\lambda = \\log(\\alpha)/U$ for some upper bound $U>0$ and some tail probaility $0<\\alpha<1$ so that \n$$\n\\Pr(\\theta > U) = \\alpha.\n$$\nThe specific choice of $U$ will depend on the context. For instance, if it's logistic regression we probably want something like^[Remember that any number on the logit scale outside of $[-3,3]$ might as well be the same number] $U=1$. If we have a GP on the log-mean of a Poisson distribution, then we probably want $U < 21.5$ if you want the _mean_ of the Poisson distribution to be less than the maximum integer^[`log(.Machine$integer.max) = 21.48756`] in R. In most data, you're gonna want^[$e^5 \\approx 148$, so 70% of the prior mass is less than that. 90% of the prior mass is less than $e^{10} \\approx 22026$ and 99% is less than $10^{13}$. This is still a weak prior.] $U\\ll 5$. If the GP is on the mean of a normal distribution, the choice of $U$ will depend on the context and scaling of the data.\n\nWithout more assumptions about the form of the covariance function, it is impossible to choose a base model for the other parameters $\\theta$.\n\nThat said, there is one special case that's important: the case where $\\sigma = \\ell$ is a single parameter controlling the intrinsic length scale, that is the distance at which the correlation between two points $\\ell$ units apart is approximately zero. The larger $\\ell$ is, the more correlated observations of the GP are and, hence, the less wiggly its realisation is. On the other hand, as $\\ell \\rightarrow 0$, the observations GP often behaves like realisations from an iid Gaussian and the GP becomes^[Conceptually. The mathematics of what happens as $\\ell \\rightarrow 0$ aren't really worth focusing on.] wilder and wilder.\n\nThis suggests that a good base model for the length-scale parameter would be $\\ell = \\infty$. We note that if both the base model and the alternative have the same value of $\\sigma$, then it cancels out in the KL-divergence. Under this assumption, we get that\n$$\nd(\\ell \\mid \\sigma) = \\text{``}\\lim_{\\ell_0\\rightarrow \\infty}\\text{''} \\sqrt{\\operatorname{tr}\\left(R(\\ell_0)^{-1}R(\\ell)\\right)  - \\log \\det R(\\ell) + \\log \\det R(\\ell_0) - n},\n$$\nwhere I'm being a bit cheeky putting that limit in, as we might need to do some singular model jigery-pokery of the same type we needed to do [for the standard deviation](https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-08-29-priors4/priors4.html#the-speed-of-a-battered-sav-proximity-to-the-base-model). We will formalise^[It's going to turn out that we don't have to do anything weird, but I don't want to discount the posibility.] this, I promise.\n\nAs the model gets more complex as the length scale decreases, we want our prior to control the smallest value $\\ell$ can take. This suggests we want to choose $\\lambda$ to ensure \n$$\n\\Pr(\\ell < L) = \\alpha.\n$$\nHow do we choose the lower bound $L$? One idea is that our prior should have very little probability of the length scale being smaller than the length-scale of the data. So we can chose $L$ to be the smallest distance between observations (if the data is regularly spaced) or as a low quantile of the distribution of distances between nearest neighbours. \n\nAll of this will specify a PC prior for a Gaussian process. So let's now discuss why that prior is a bit shit.\n\n### What's bad about this?\n\nThe prior on the standard deviation is fine.\n\nThe prior on the length scale is more of an issue. There are a couple of bad things about this prior. The first one might seem innocuous at first glance. We decided to treat the GP as a multivariate Gaussian with covariance matrix $\\sigma^2 R(\\theta)$.\nThis is not a neutral choice. In order to do it, we need to _commit_ to a certain set of observation locations^[Or, you know, linear functionals]. Why? The matrix $R(\\theta)$ depends entirely on the observation locations and if we use this matrix to define the prior we are tied to those locations. \n\nThis means that if we change the amount of data in the model we will need to change the prior. This is going to play havoc^[You can find Bayesians who say that they don't care if cross validation works or not. You can find Bayesians who will say just about anything.] on any sort of cross-validation! It's worth saying that the other two sources of information (the minimum length scale and the upper bound on $\\sigma$) are not nearly as sensitive to small changes in the data. This information is, in some sense, fundamental to the problem at hand and, therefore, much more stable ground to build your prior upon.\n\nThere's another problem, of course: this prior is expensive to compute. The KL divergence involves computing $\\operatorname{tr}(R(\\ell_0)^{-1}R(\\ell))$ which costs as much as another log-density evaluation for the Gaussian process (which is to say it's very expensive).\n\nSo this prior is going to be _deeply_ inconvenient if we have varying amounts of data (through cross-validation or sequential data gathering). It's also going to be wildly more computationally expensive than you expect a one-dimensional prior to be.\n\nAll in all, it seems a bit shit.\n\n### The Matérn covariance fucntion\n\nIt won't be possible to derive a prior for a general Gaussian process, so we are going to need to make some simplifying assumptions. The assumption that we are going to make is that the \ncovariance comes from the Whittle-Matérn^[There are lots of parameterisations, but they're all easy to move between. Compared to wikipedia, we use the $\\sqrt{8}$ scaling rather than the $\\sqrt{2}$ scaling.] ^[Everything in this post can be easily generalised to having different length scales on each dimension.] class \n$$\nc(s, s') = \\sigma^2 \\frac{2^{1-\\nu}}{\\Gamma(\\nu)}\\left(\\sqrt{8\\nu}\\frac{\\|s-s'\\|}{\\ell}\\right)^\\nu K_\\nu\\left(\\sqrt{8\\nu}\\frac{\\|s-s'\\|}{\\ell}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\nu$ is the _smoothness_ parameter, $\\ell$ is the _length-scale_ parameter, $\\sigma$ is the _marginal standard deviation_, and \n$$\nK_\\nu(x) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x\\cosh t}\\cosh(\\nu t)\\,dt\n$$\nis the modified Bessel^[If you've not run into these before, $x^{\\nu}K_\\nu(x)$ is [finite at zero](https://functions.wolfram.com/Bessel-TypeFunctions/BesselK/06/01/04/01/03/) and decreases monotonically in an exponential-ish fashion as $x\\rightarrow \\infty$.] function of the second kind.\n\nThis class of covariance function is extremely important in practice. It interpolates between two of the most common covariance functions: \n\n- when $\\nu = 1/2$, it corresponds to the exponential covariance function,\n- when $\\nu = \\infty$, it corresponds to the square exponential covariance.\n\nThere are years of experience suggesting that Matérn covariance functions with finite $\\nu$ perform better than the square exponential covariance.\n\nCommon practice is to fix^[Possibly trying several values and either selecting the best or stacking all of the models] the value of $\\nu$. There are a few reasons for this. One of the most compelling practical reasons is that we can't easily evaluate its derivative, which rules out most modern optimisation and MCMC algorithms. It's also _very_ difficult to think about how you would set a prior on it. The techniques in this post will not help, and as far as I've ever been able to tell, nothing else will either.  Finally, you could expect there to be _horrible_ confounding between $\\nu$, $\\ell$, and $\\sigma$, which will make inference very hard (both numerically and morally).\n\nIt turns out that even with $\\nu$ fixed, we will run into a few problems. But to understand those, we are going to need to know a bit more about how inferring parameters in a Gaussian processes actually works.\n\nJust for future warning, I will occasionally refer to a GP with a Matérn covariance function as a \"Matérn field\"^[Field because by rights GPs with multidimensional parameter spaces should be called _Gaussian Fields_ but we can't have nice things so whatever. Live your lives.].\n\n\n### Asymptotics? I barely know her!\n\nLet's take a brief detour into classical inference for a moment and ask ourselves\n_when can we recover the parameters of a Gaussian process_? For most models we \nrun into in statistics, the answer to that question is _when we get enough data_.\nBut for Gaussian processes, the story is more complex.\n\nFirst of all, there is the very real question of what we mean by getting more data.\nWhen our observations are iid, this so easy that when asked how she got more data, Kylie just said she [\"did it again\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDKPvy-ZXC8).\n\nBut this is more complex once data has dependence. For instance, in a multilevel \nmodel you could have the number of groups staying fixed while the number of observations in each group goes to infinity, you could have the number of observations in each group staying fixed while the number of groups go to infinity, or you could have both^[At which point you need to ask yourself if one goes their faster. It's chaos.] going to infinity.\n\nFor Gaussian processes it also gets quite complicated. Here is a non-exhaustive list of options:\n\n- You observe the same realisation of the GP at an increasing number of points that eventually cover the _whole of_ $\\mathbb{R}^d$ (this is called the _increasing domain_ or _outfill_ regime); or\n- You observe the same realisation of the GP at an increasing number of points _that stay within a fixed domain_ (this is called the _fixed domain_ or _infill_ regime); or\n- You observe multiple realisations of the same GP at a finite number of points that stay in the same location (this does not have a name, in space-time it's sometimes called _monitoring data_); or\n- You observe multiple realisations of the same GP at a (possibly different) finite number of points that can be in different locations for different realisations; or\n- You observe realisations of a process that evolves in space _and_ time (not really a different regime so much as a different problem).\n\nOne of the truly unsettling things about Gaussian processes is that the ability to estimate the parameters depends on which of these regimes you choose!\n\nOf course, we all know that asymptotic regimes are just polite fantasies that statisticians concoct in order to self-soothe. They are not reflections on reality. They serve approximately the same purpose^[Asymptotics as copaganda.] as watching a chain of Law and Order episodes.\n\nThe real purpose of thinking about what happens when we get more data is to use it as a loose approximation of what happens with the data you have. So the real question is _which regime is the most realistic for my data_?. \n\nOne way you can approach this question is to ask yourself what you would do if you\nhad the budget to get more data. My work has mostly been in spatial statistics, in which case the answer is _usually_^[I mean, if you can repeat experiments that's obviously amazing, but there are lots of situations where that is either not possible or not the greatest use of resources. There's an interesting subfield of statistical earth sciences that focuses on working out the value of getting new types of observations in spatial data. This particular variant of the value of information problem throws up some fun corners.] that you would sample more points in the same area. This suggests that fixed-domain asymptotics is a good fit for my needs. I'd expect that\nin most GP regression cases, we're not expecting^[or hoping] that further observations would be on new parts of the covariate space, which would suggest fixed-domain asymptotics are usefulthere too.\n\nThis, it turns out, is awkward.\n\n### When is a parameter not consistently estimatable: an aside that will almost immediately become relevant\n\nThe problem with a GP with the Matérn covariance function on a fixed domain is\nthat it's not possible^[in 3 or fewer dimensions] to estimate all of its parameters at the same time. This isn't the case for the other \nasymptotic regime, but you've got to dance with who you came to the dance with.\n\nTo make this more concrete, we need to think about a Gaussian process as a realisation of a function rather than as a vector of observations. Why? Because under fixed-domain asymptotics we are seeing values of the function closer and cloer together until we essentailly see the entire function on that domain.\n\nOf course, this is why I wrote [a long and technical blog post](https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-03-yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness/yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness.html) on understanding Gaussian processes as random functions. But don't worry. You don't need to have read that part.\n\nThe key thing is that because a GP is a function, we need to think of it's probability of being in a set $A$ of functions. There will be a set of function $\\operatorname{supp}(u)$, which we call the _support_ of $u(\\cdot)$ that is the smallest set such that \n$$\n\\Pr(u(\\cdot) \\in \\operatorname{supp}(u)) = 1.\n$$\nEvery GP has an associated support and, while you probably don't think much about it, GPs are _obsessed_ with their supports. They love them. They hug them. They share them with their friends. They keep them from their enemies. And they are one of the key things that we need to think about in order to understand why it's hard to estimate parameters in a Matérn covariance function.\n\nThere is a key theorem that is unique^[I have not fact checked this] to Gaussian processes.\nIt's usually phrased in terms of _Gaussian measures_, which are just the probability associated with a GP. For example, if $u_1(\\cdot)$ is a GP then\n$$\n\\mu_1(A) = \\Pr(u_1(\\cdot) \\in A)\n$$\nis the corresponding Gaussian measure. We can express the support of $u(\\cdot)$ as the smallest set of functions such that $\\mu(A)=1$.\n\n\n::: {#thm-singular-equiv}\n\n## Feldman-Hájek theorem\n\nTwo Gaussian measures $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ with corresponding GPs $u_1(\\cdot)$ and $u_2(\\cdot)$ on a locally convex space^[Basically everything you care about.

In finite dimensions (aka most of statistics) _every_ Gaussian is equivalent to every other Gaussian. In fact, it's equivalent to every other continuous distribution with non-zero density on the whole of $\\mathbb{R}^d$. But shit gets weird when you're dealing with functions and we just need to take a hit of the video head cleaner and breathe until we get used to it.] (confusingly^[These measures _are not the same_.

In fact, if $u_2(\\cdot) = \\alpha u_1(\\cdot)$ for any $|\\alpha|\\neq 1$, then $\\mu_1 \\perp \\mu_2$!\n\nThis seems like it will cause problems. And it can^[eg, computationally where Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probabilities have an annoying tendency to go to zero unless you are extraordinarily careful.].

Hence, if $u_1(\\cdot)$ and $u_2(\\cdot)$ are singular, we can (on average) choose the correct one using a likelihood ratio test. This means that we will be able to correctly recover the true^[if it exists] parameter.\n\nIt turns out the opposite is also true. \n\n::: {#thm-strong-neg}\n\nIf $\\mu_\\theta$, $\\theta \\in \\Theta$ is a family of Gaussian measures corresponding to the GPs $u_\\theta(\\cdot)$ and $\\mu_\\theta \\equiv \\mu_{\\theta'}$ for all values of $\\theta, \\theta' \\in \\Theta$, then there is _no_ sequence of estimators $\\hat \\theta_n$ such that, for all $\\theta_0 \\in \\Theta$ \n$$\n{\\Pr}_{\\theta_0}(\\hat \\theta_n \\rightarrow \\theta_0) = 1,\n$$\nwhere ${\\Pr}_{\\theta_0}(\\cdot)$ is the probability under data drawn with true parameter $\\theta_0$.

It's a bit less disastrous this time, but it's not excellent even with 500 observations (which is a decent number on a unit square). The weird structure of the prior is still going to lead to a long, non-elliptical shape in your posterior that your computational engine (and your person interpreting the results) are going to have to come to terms with. \n\nUnless, of course, the prior can save you.\n\n### So the prior is important then! What do other people do?\n\nThat ridge in the likelihood surface does not go away in low dimensions, which essentially means that our inference along that ridge is going to be driven by the prior.\n\nPossibly the worst choice you could make in this situation is trying to make a minimally informative prior. Of course, that's what [somebody did when they made a reference prior for the problem](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Objective+Bayesian+Analysis+of+Spatially+Correlated+Data%2C&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). In fact it was the first paper^[That I could find] that looks rigorously at prior distributions on the parameters of GPs. It's just unfortunate that it's quite shit. It has still been cited quite a lot. And there are some technical advances to the theory of reference priors, but if you use it you just find yourself mapping out that damn ridge.\n\nOn top of being, structurally, a bad choice, the reference prior has a few other downsides:\n\n- It is very computationally intensive and quite complex. Not unlike the bad version of the PC prior!\n- It requires _strong_ assumptions about the likelihood. The first version assumed that there was no observation noise. Later papers allowed there to be observation noise. But only if it's Gaussian.\n- It is derived under the asymptotic regime where an infinite sequence of different independent realisations of the GP are observed at the same finite set of points. This is not the most useful regime for GPs.\n\nAll in all, it's a bit of a casserole. \n\nFrom the other end, there's a very interesting contribution from [Aad van der Vaart and Harry van Zanten](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.3556.pdf) wrote a very lovely theoretical paper that looked at which priors on $\\ell$ could result in theoretically optimal posterior contraction  rates. They argued that $\\ell^{-d}$ should have a Gamma distribution. Within the Matérn class, their results are only valid for the squared exponential contrivance function.\n\nOne of the stranger things that I have never fully understood is that the argument I'm going to make below ends up with a gamma distribution on $\\ell^{-d/2}$, which is somewhat different to van der Vaart and van Zanten. If I was to being forced to bullshit some justification I'd probably say something about the Matern process depending only on the distance between observations makes the $d$-sphere the natural geometry (the volume of which scales like $\\ell^{-d/2}$) rather than the $d$-cube (the volume of which scales lie $\\ell^{-d}$). But that would be total bullshit. I simply have no idea. They're proposal comes via the time-honoured tradition of \"constant chasing\" in some fairly tricky proofs, so I have absolutely no intuition for it.\n\nWe also found in other contexts that use the KL divergence rather than its square root tended to perform worse. So I'm kinda happy with our scaling and their's doesn't cover the same case anyway.\n\nNeither of these papers consider that ridge in the likelihood surface.\n\nThis lack of consideration---as well as their success in everything else we tried them on---was a big part of our push to make a useful version of a PC prior for Gaussian processes.\n\n\n### Rescuing the PC prior; or What I recommend you do\n\nIt has been a long journey, but we are finally where I wanted us to be. So let's talk about how to fix the PC prior. In particular, I'm going to go through how to derive a prior on the length scale $\\ell$ that has a simple form.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, we are going to do three things in the rest of this post:\n\n1. Restrict our attention to the stationary^[Saddle up for some spectral theory.] GPs \n1. Restrict our attention to the Matérn class of covariance functions. \n1. Greatly increase our mathematical^[I'm terribly sorry.] sophistication.\n\nBut before we do that, I'm going to walk you through the punchline.\n\nThis work was originally done with the magnificent [Geir-Arne Fuglstad](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/fuglstad), the glorious [Finn Lindren](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~flindgre/), and the resplendent [Håvard Rue](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/haavard-rue). If you want to read the original paper, [the preprint is here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00256)^[I'm moderately sure that the preprint is pretty similar to the published version but I am not going to check.].\n\nThe short version is that the PC prior for the length scale in a $d$-dimensional space is a Fréchet distribution^[With this parameterisation it's sometimes known as a Type-II Gumbel distribution. Because why not.] with shape parameter $d/2$. That is, \n$$\np(\\ell) = \\frac{d\\lambda_\\ell}{2} \\ell^{-(d/2+1)}e^{-\\lambda_{\\ell}\\ell^{-d/2}},\n$$\nwhere we choose $\\lambda_\\ell = -\\log(\\alpha_\\ell)L^{d/2}$ to ensure that \n$$\n\\Pr(\\ell < L) = e^{-\\lambda L^{-d/2}} < \\alpha_\\ell.\n$$\nIn two dimensions, this is an inverse gamma prior, which gives rigorous justification to a commonly used prior in spatial statistics.\n\n\n### Comparing it with the reference prior\n\n**Tbh I'm not sure if this is needed. Thoughts?**\n\n\n\n### Moving beyond the Matérn\n**This is needed. I will write it tomorrow**\n\n### What's in the rest of the post?\n\nThe remainder of this post will be devoted to deriving the PC prior. It's going to get a bit hairy and I'm going to assume you've at least skimmed through the first 2 definitions in my [previous post defining GPs](https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-03-yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness/yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness.html).\n\nThe main purpose of the rest of the post is to show the types of things that you need to think about to get the relatively straighforward prior. Because if I had to suffer you all have to suffer.\n\n\n\n## An invitation to the theory of Stationary Gaussian processes\n\nGaussian processes with the Matérn covariance function are an excellent example of a stationary^[In fact, it's isotropic, which is a stricter condition on most spaces. But there's no real reason to specialise to isotropic processes so we simply won't.] Gaussian process, which are characterised^[We are assuming that the mean is zero, but absent that assumption, we need to assume that the mean is constant.] ^[For non-Gaussian processes, this property is known as _second-order_ stationarity. For GPs this corresponds to stong stationary, which is a property of the distribution rather than the covariance functio ] by have covariance functions of the form \n$$\nc(s, s') = c(s- s'),\n$$\nwhere I am abusing notation and using $c$ for both the two parameter and one parameter functions. This assumption means that the correlation structure does not depend on where you are in space, only on the distance between points.\n\nThe assumption of stationarity massively simplifies GPs. Firstly, the stationarity assumption greatly reduces the number of parameters you need to describe a GP as we don't need to worry about location-specific parameters. Secondly, it increases the statistical power of the model. If two subsets of the domain are more than $2\\ell$ apart, they are essentially independent replicates of the GP with the same parameters. This means that if the locations $s$ vary across a large enough area (relative to the natural length scale), we get multiple effective replicates^[If you've been exposed to the concept of ergodicity of random fields you may be eligible for compensation.] from the same realisation of the process.\n\nIn practice, stationarity^[Possibly with varying length scales or some other form of anisotropy] is often a _good enough_ assumption when the mean has been modelled carefully, [especially given the limitations of the data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0743). That said, priors on non-stationary processes can be set using the PC prior methodology by using a stationary process as the base model. The [supplementary material](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00256) of our paper gives a simple, but useful, example of this.\n\n### Stationary covariance functions and Bochner's theorem\n\nThe restriction to stationary processes is _extremely_ powerful. It opens us up to using Fourier analysis as a potent tool for understanding GPs. We are going to need this to construct our KL divergence, and so with some trepidation, let's dive into the moonee ponds of spectral representations.\n\nThe first thing that we need to do is remember what a [_Fourier transform_] is. A Fourier transform of a square integrable function $\\phi(s)$ is^[This is normalisation is to make my life easier.] \n$$\n\\hat \\phi(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}(\\phi)(\\omega) =\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^d}\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} e^{-i\\omega^Ts}\\phi(s) \\,ds.\n$$\n\nIf you have bad memories^[Let's not lie, I just jumped straight to complex numbers.

And it always is.\n\n### The Cameron-Martin^[Also known as the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space even though it doesn't actually have to be one. This is the space of all means. See the previous GP blog.] space of a stationary Gaussian process\n\nOne particular advantage of stationary processes is that we get a straightforward characterization of the Cameron-Martin space inner product. Recall that the Cameron-Martin space (or reproducing kernel Hilbert space) associated with a Gaussian process is the^[closure of the] space of all functions of the form \n$$\nh(s) = \\sum_{k=1}^K c_k c(s, s_k),\n$$\nwhere $K$ is finite, $c_k$ are real, and $s_k$ are distinct points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. This is the space that the posterior mean for GP regression lives in.\n\nThe inner product associated with this space can be written in terms of the spectral density $f$ as^[In [the previous post](https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-03-yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness/yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness.html), I wrote this in terms of the inverse of the covariance operator. For a stationary operator, the covariance operator is (by the convolution theorem) $$\nCh(s) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}e^{i\\omega s}\\hat{h}(\\omega) f(\\omega)\\,d\\omega\n$$ and it should be pretty easy to convince yourself that $$\nC^{-1}h(s) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}e^{i\\omega s}\\hat{h}(\\omega) \\frac{1}{f(\\omega)}\\,d\\omega.\n$$] \n$$\n\\langle h, h'\\rangle = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} \\hat h(\\omega) \\overline{\\hat {h'}(\\omega)} \\frac{1}{f(\\omega)}\\,d\\omega.\n$$\nIn particular, for a Matérn Gaussian process, the corresponding norm is \n$$\n\\| h\\|_{H_u} = C_\\text{Matérn}\\kappa^{2\\nu}\\sigma^2 \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d}|\\hat h(\\omega)|^2 (\\kappa^2 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^{\\nu+d/2}\\,d\\omega.\n$$\nFor those of you familiar with function spaces, this is equivalent to the norm on $H^{\\nu-d/2}(\\mathbb{R}^d)$. One way to interpret this is that the _set_ of functions in the Cameron-Martin space for a Matérn GP only depends on $\\nu$, while the norm and inner product (and hence the posterior mean and all that stuff) depend on $\\nu$, $\\kappa$, and $\\sigma$. This observation is going to be important.\n\n### Another look at equivalence and singularity \n\nIt would've been a bit of an odd choice to spend all this time talking about spectral representations and never using them. So in this section, I'm going to cover the reason for the season: singularity or absolute continuity of Gaussian measures.\n\nThe Feldman-Hájek theorem quoted is true on quite general sets of functions. However, if we are willing to restrict ourselves to a separable^[ie one where we can represent functions using a Fourier series rather than a Fourier transform] Hilbert^[ie one with an inner product] space there is a much more refined version of the theorem that we can use.\n\n::: {#thm-continuity2}\n\n## Feldman-Hájek theorem (Taylor's^[Bogachev's Gaussian Measures book, Corollary 6.4.11 with some interpretation work to make it slightly more human-readable. I also added the minus sign he missed in the density.] version)\n\nTwo Gaussian measures $\\mu_1$ (mean $m_1$, covariance operator^[Recall that this is the integral operator $C_1 f = \\int_D c_1(x,x')f(x')\\,d x'$.] $C_1$) and $\\mu_2$ (mean $m_2$, covariance operator $C_2$) on a _separable Hilbert space_ $X$ are absolutely continuous _if and only if_\n\n1. The Cameron-Martin spaces associated with $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ are the same (considered as sets of functions. They usually will not have the same inner products.),\n\n2. $m_1 - m_2$ is in the^[Because of condition 1 if it's in one of them it's in the other too!] Cameron-Martin space, and\n\n3. The operator $T = C_1^{-1/2}C_2C_1^{-1/2} - I$ is a Hilber-Schmidt operator, that is it has a countable set of eigenvalues $\\delta_k$ and corresponding eigenfunctions $[hi_k$ that satisfy $\\delta_k > -1$ and \n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\delta_k^2 < \\infty.\n$$\nWhen these three conditions are fulfilled, the Radon-Nikodym derivative is \n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu_2}{d\\mu_1} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{\\delta_k}{1 + \\delta_k}\\eta_k^2 - \\log(1+\\delta_k)\\right)\\right],\n$$\nwhere $\\eta_k$ is an sequence of N(0,1) random variables^[Technically, they are an orthonormal basis in the closure of $\\{\\ell -\\mu(\\ell) : \\ell \\in X^* \\}$ under the $R_{u_1}$ norm, but let's just be friendly to ourselves and pretend $u_j$ have zero mean so these spaces are the same. The theorem is very explicit about what they are. If $\\phi_k$ are the ($X$-orthonormal) eigenfunctions corresponding to $\\delta_k$, then $$\n\\eta_k = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} C_1^{1/2}\\phi_k(s)\\,dW_1(s),\n$$ where $W_1(s)$ is the spectral process associated with $u_1$. Give or take, this the same thing I said in the main text.] ^[After reading all of that, let me tell you that it simply does not matter even a little bit.] (under $\\mu_1$).\n\nOtherwise, the two measures are singular.\n:::\n\nThis version of Feldman-Hájek is considerably more useful than its previous incarnation. The first condition basically says that the posterior means from the two priors will have the same smoothness and is rarely a problem. Typically the second condition is fulfilled in practice (for example, we always set the mean to zero). \n\nThe third condition is where all of the action is. This is, roughly speaking, a condition that says that $C_1$ and $C_2$ aren't toooooo different. To understand this, we need to look a little at what the $\\delta_k$ values actually are. It turns out to actually be easier to ask about $1+ \\delta_k$, which are the eigenvalues of $C_1^{-1/2}C_2 C_1^{-1/2}$. In that case, we are trying to find the orthonormal system of functions $\\phi_k\\in X$ such that \n\\begin{align*}\nC_1^{-1/2}C_2 C_1^{-1/2}\\phi_k &= (1+\\delta_k) \\phi_k \\\\\nC^{-1/2}C_2 \\psi_k &= (1+\\delta_k) C_1^{1/2}\\psi_k \\\\\nC_2\\psi_k &=(1+\\delta_k) C_1\\psi_k,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\psi_k = C_1^{-1/2}\\phi_k$. \n\nHence, we can roughly interpret the $\\delta_k$ as the eigenvalues of \n$$\nC_1^{-1}C_2 - I.\n$$ The Hilbert-Schmidt condition is then requiring that $C_1^{-1}C_2$ is not infinitely far from the identity mapping.\n\n\nA particularly nice version of this theorem occurs when $C_1$ and $C_2$ have the _same_ eigenvectors. This is a fairly restrictive assumption, but we are going to end up using it later, so it's worth specialising.  In that case, assuming $C_j$ has eigenvalues $\\lambda_k^{(j)}$ and correpsonding $L^2$-orthogonal eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(\\cdot)$, we can write^[Yes - this is Mercer's theorem again. The only difference is that we are assuming that the eigenfunctions are the same for each $j$ so they don't need an index.] \n$$\n[C_jh](s) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\lambda_k^{(j)} \\langle\\phi_k, h\\rangle \\phi_k(s).\n$$\nUsing the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions, we can show^[\\begin{align*}\nC_j^\\beta[C_j^{-\\beta}h] &= \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty (\\lambda_m^{(j)})^\\beta \\left\\langle\\phi_m, \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (\\lambda_k^{(j)})^{-\\beta} \\langle\\phi_k, h\\rangle \\phi_k\\right\\rangle \\phi_m \\\\\n&= \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty (\\lambda_m^{(j)})^\\beta\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (\\lambda_k^{(j)})^{-\\beta} \\langle\\phi_k, h\\rangle \\left\\langle\\phi_m,   \\phi_k\\right\\rangle \\phi_m \\\\\n&=\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty (\\lambda_m^{(j)})^\\beta (\\lambda_m^{(j)})^{-\\beta} \\langle\\phi_m, h\\rangle \\phi_m \\\\\n&= h\n\\end{align*}] that \n$$\n[C_j^{\\beta}h](s)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (\\lambda_k^{(j)})^\\beta \\langle\\phi_k, h\\rangle \\phi_k(s).\n$$\n\nWith a bit of effort, we can see that \n$$\n(C_1^{-1/2}C_2C_1^{-1/2} - I)h = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\lambda_k^{(2)} - \\lambda_k^{(1)}}{\\lambda_k^{(1)}} \\langle\\phi_k, h\\rangle \\phi_k\n$$\nand so \n$$\n\\delta_k = \\frac{\\lambda_k^{(2)} - \\lambda_k^{(1)}}{\\lambda_k^{(1)}}.\n$$\nFrom that, we get^[You simply cannot make me care enough to prove that we can swap summation and expectation.

So I lied. I suggested that we'd use all of that spectral stuff in the last section. And we didn't! Because I'm dastardly. But this time I promise we will!\n\nIt turns out that even with our fancy version of Feldman-Hájek, it can be difficult^[But not impossible. [Kristin Kirchner and David Bolin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08904) have done some very nice work on this recently.] to work out whether two Gaussian processes are singular or equivalent.

Then it's clear that \n$\\kappa_1^{2\\nu}\\sigma_3^2 = \\kappa_2^{2\\nu}\\sigma_2^2$ and therefore the Matérn field with parameters $(\\kappa_1, \\sigma_3, \\nu)$ is equivalent to $u_2(\\cdot)$. \n\nWe will now show that $u_1$ and $u_3$ are singular, which implies that $u_1$ and $u_2$ are singular.

Hooray!\n\n### Approximating the Kullback-Leibler divergence for a Matérn random field\n\nNow, you can find a proof of this in the appendix of our JASA paper, but to be honest it's quite informal. But although you can sneak any old shite into JASA, this is a blog goddamnit and a blog has integrity. So let's do a significantly more rigorous proof of our argument.\n\nTo do this, we will need to find the KL divergence between $u_1$, with parameters $(\\kappa, \\tau \\kappa_1^{-\\nu}, \\nu)$ and a base model $u_0$ with parameters $(\\kappa_0, \\tau \\kappa_0^{-\\nu})$, where $\\kappa_0$ is some fixed, small number and $\\tau >0$ is fixed. We will actually be interested in the behaviour of the KL divergence as $\\kappa_0$ goes to zero. Why? Well we will talk about base models in the next section. And then you'll know why. Please have some patience.\n\nThe specific choice of standard deviation in both models ensures that $\\kappa^{2\\nu}\\sigma^2 = \\kappa_0^{2\\nu}\\sigma_0^2$ and so the KL divergence is finite.\n\nIn order to approximate the KL divergence, we are going to find a basis that simultaneously diagonalises both processes. In the paper, we simply declared that we could do this. And, morally, we can. But as I said a blog aims to a higher standard than mere morality. Here we strive for meaningless rigour.\n\nTo that end, we are going to spend a moment thinking about how this can be done in a way that isn't intrinsically tied to a given domain $D$. There may well be a lot of different ways to do this, but the most obvious one is to notice that if $u(\\cdot)$ is _periodic_ on the cube $[-L,L]^d$ for some $L \\gg 0$, then it can be considered as a GP on a $d$-dimensional torus.\n\nA nice thing about periodic GPs is that we actually know their Karhunen-Loève^[The other KL. The spicy, secret KL. KL after dark. What Loève but a second-hand Karhunen?] representation. In particular, if $c_p(\\cdot)$ is a stationary covariance function on a torus, then we know that it's eigenfunctions are \n$$\n\\phi_k(s) = e^{-\\frac{2\\pi i}{L} k^Th}, \\quad k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^d\n$$\nand its eigenvalues are \n$$\n\\lambda_k = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^d} e^{-\\frac{2\\pi i}{L} k^Th} c_p(h)\\,dh.\n$$\nThis gives^[Specifically, this kinda funky set of normalisation choices that statisticians love to make gives]\n$$\nc_p(h) = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^d \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^d}\\lambda_k  e^{-\\frac{2\\pi i}{L} k^Th}.\n$$\n\nNow we have some work to do.  Firstly, our process is not periodic on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. That's a bit of a barrier. Secondly, even if it were, we don't actually know what $\\lambda_k$ is going to be. This is probably^[We will see that this is not an issue, but you better bloody believe that our JASA paper just breezed the fuck past these issues. Proof by citations that didn't actually say what we needed them to say but were close enough for government work. Again, this is one of those situations where the thing we are doing is obviously valid, but the specifics (which are unimportant for our situation because we are going to send $\\kappa_0\\rightarrow 0$ and $L \\rightarrow \\infty$ in a way that's _much_ faster than $\\kappa_0^{-1}$) are tedious and, I cannot stress this enough, completely unimportant in this context. But it's a fucking blog and a blog has fucking integrity that the Journal of the American Fucking Statistical Association does not even almost claim to have. I've had some red wine.] an issue.\n\nSo let's make this sucker periodic.  The trick is to note that, at long enough distances, $u(s)$ and $u(s')$ are almost uncorrelated. In particular, if $\\|s - s'| \\gg \\ell$, then $\\operatorname{Cov}(u(s), u(s')) \\approx 0$. This means that if we are interested in $u(\\cdot)$ on a fixed domain $D$, then we can replace it with $u_p(s)$ that is a GP where the covariance function $c_p(\\cdot)$ is the periodic extension of $c(h)$ from $[-L,L]^d$ to $\\mathbb{R}^d$ (aka we just repeat it!).\n\nThis repetition won't be noticed on $D$ as long as $L$ is big enough. But we can run into the small^[big] problem. This procedure can lead to a covariance function $c_p(\\cdot)$ that is _not_ positive definite. Big problem.\n\nIt turns out that one way to fix this is is to use a smooth cutoff function $\\delta(h)$ that is 1 on $[-L,L]^d$ and 0 outside of $[-\\gamma,\\gamma]^d$, where $L>0$ is big enough so that $D \\subset [-L, L]^d$ and $\\gamma > L$. We can then build the periodic extension of a stationary covariance function $c(\\cdot)$ as \n$$\nc_p(h) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^d}c(x + 2Lk)\\delta(x + 2 Lk).\n$$\nIt's important^[I cannot stress enough that we're not bloody implementing this scheme, so it's not even slightly important. Scan on, McDuff.] to note that this is not the same thing as simply repeating the covariance function in a periodic manner. Near the boundaries (but outside of the domain) there will be some \"wrap-around\" contamination. [Bachmayr, Cohen, and Migliorati](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05559) show that this _does not work_ for general stationary covariance functions, but does work under the additional condition that $\\gamma$ is big enough and there exist some $s \\geq r > d/2$ and $0 < \\underline{C} \\leq \\overline{C} < \\infty$ such that \n$$\n\\underline{C}(1 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^{-s} \\leq f(\\omega)\\leq \\overline{C}(1 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^{-r}.\n$$\nThis condition obviously holds for the Matérn covariance function and [Bachmayr, Graham, Nguyen, and Scheichl](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13522)^[Fun fact. I worked in the same department as authors 2 and 4 for a while and they are both very lovely.] showed that $\\gamma > A(\\nu)\\ell$ is sufficient to make this work.\n\nThe nice thing about this procedure is that $c_p(s-s') = c(s-s')$ as long as $s, s' \\in D$, which means that our inference is going to be _identical_ on our sample as it would be with the non-periodic covariance function! Splendid!\n\nNow that we have made a valid periodic extension (and hence we know what the eigenfunctions are), we need to work out what the corresponding eigenvalues are.\n\nWe know that \n$$\n \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} e^{-\\frac{\\pi i}{L}k^Th}c(h)\\,dh = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}k\\right).\n$$\nBut it is not clear what will happen when we take the Fourier transform of $c_p(\\cdot)$. \n\nThankfully, the convolution theorem is here to help us and we know that, if $\\theta(s) = 1 - \\delta(s)$, then \n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} e^{-\\frac{\\pi i}{L}k^Th}(c(h) - c_p(h))\\,dh = (\\hat{\\theta}*f)\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}k\\right),\n$$\nwhere $*$ is the convolution operator.\n\nIn the perfect world, $(\\hat{\\theta}*f)(\\omega)$ would be very close to zero, so we can just replace the Fourier transform of $c_p$ with the Fourier transform of $c$. And thank god we live in a perfect world.\n\nThe specifics here are a bit tedious^[Check out either of the Bachmayr _et al._ papers if you're interested.], but you can show that  $(\\hat{\\theta}*f)(\\omega) \\rightarrow 0$ as $\\gamma \\rightarrow \\infty$. For Matérn fields, Bachmayr etc performed some heroic calculations to show that the difference is exponentially small as $\\gamma \\rightarrow \\infty$ and that, as long as $\\gamma > A(\\nu) \\ell$, everything is positive definite and lovely.\n\nSo after a bunch of effort and a bit of a literature dive, we have finally got a simultaneous eigenbasis and we can write our KL divergene as \n\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{KL}(u_1 || u_0) &= \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\omega \\in \\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\mathbb{Z}}\\left[\\frac{f_1(\\omega)}{f_0(\\omega)} - 1 - \\log \\left(\\frac{f_1(\\omega)}{f_0(\\omega)}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\omega \\in \\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\mathbb{Z}}\\left[\\frac{(\\kappa_0^2 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^\\alpha}{(\\kappa^2 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^\\alpha} - 1 - \\log \\left(\\frac{(\\kappa_0^2 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^\\alpha}{(\\kappa^2 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^\\alpha} \\right)\\right].\n\\end{align*}\nWe can write this as \n$$\n\\operatorname{KL}(u_1 || u_0) =\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{L \\kappa}{2\\pi}\\right)^d \\sum_{\\omega \\in \\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\mathbb{Z}}\\left(\\left[\\frac{(\\kappa_0^2 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^\\alpha}{(\\kappa^2 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^\\alpha} - 1 - \\log \\left(\\frac{(\\kappa_0^2 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^\\alpha}{(\\kappa^2 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^\\alpha} \\right)\\right]\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L \\kappa}\\right)^d\\right).\n$$\nThen, noticing that the sum is just a trapesium rule approximation to an integrand, we get, as $\\kappa_0 \\rightarrow 0$ (and hence $L, \\gamma\\rightarrow \\infty$),\n$$\n\\operatorname{KL}(u_1 || u_0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{L \\kappa}{2\\pi}\\right)^d \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d}\\left[\\frac{((\\kappa_0/\\kappa)^2 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^\\alpha}{(1 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^\\alpha} - 1 - \\log \\left(\\frac{((\\kappa_0/\\kappa)^2 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^\\alpha}{(1 + \\|\\omega\\|^2)^\\alpha} \\right)\\right] + o(1).\n$$\nThe integral converges whenever $d \\leq 3$.\n\nThis suggests that we can rescale the distance by absorbing the $(L/(2\\pi^d))$ into the constant in the PC prior, and get \n$$\nd(\\kappa) = \\kappa^{d/2}.\n$$\n\n\n\n\n\n### The PC prior for $(\\sigma, \\ell)$\n\nHere goes the PC prior scaling stuff and justification of the base model.\n",
