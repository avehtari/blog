        "It turns out that I did something a little controversial in [last week's](https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-12-08-the-king-must-die-repost/)^[Imagine it's November 2017.] post. As these things always go, it wasn't the thing I was expecting to get push back from, but rather what I thought was a fairly innocuous scaling of the prior. [One commenter](http://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2017/11/02/king-must-die/#comment-601142) (and a few other people on other communication channels) pointed out that the dependence of the prior on the design didn't seem kosher.  Of course, we (Andrew, Mike and I) wrote a paper that was sort of about this a [few months ago](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/entropy-19-00555-v2.pdf)^[Again, 2017.], but it's one of those really interesting topics that we can probably all deal with thinking more about.\n",

        "So in this post, I'm going to go into a couple of situations where it makes sense to scale the prior based on fixed information about the experiment.
